Silicon polycrystalline photovoltaic cell data set

This data set was generated synthetically in order to train a neural network. The neural network may be able to characterize a photovoltaic cell (know the parameters of the one-diode model) from the manufacturer's data sheet.

Two assumptions are taken into account in this data set: the shunt resistance is ideal and the diode ideality constant is equal to 1.3
